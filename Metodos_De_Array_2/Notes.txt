In this class we are going to learn 
about some methods that doesn't 
modify the original array.

The firts method is: 
-> map()

Creates a new arrays a partir
of another array.

-> Original = [1,2,3,4,5]
-> Method_Array = [2,4,6,8,10]

The second one is:
-> forEach()

It's similar to map() method but 
the differences is that doesn't 
return anything. But the arrow 
function still working.

The third one is:
-> filter()

Creates anew array but based on 
a condition.

-> Original = [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]
-> filter_Method = [5, 7, 11]

The fourth one is:
-> reduce()

Reduce the array on to a value.

-> Original = [1, 2, 3, 4]
-> reduce_Method = 10

The fifth one is:
-> find()

Return the firts value that is true 
in a condition.

-> Original = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90]
-> find_Method = 78

The sixth one is:
-> findIndex()

It's like the find method but returns
the INDEX of the firts value thats true 
to the condition.

-> Original = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90]
-> findIndex_Method = 3
